## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>
Here we will predict if the Falcon 9 fist stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the saving is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, If we can determine if the first stage will land successfully. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

In this capstone, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I have to do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
